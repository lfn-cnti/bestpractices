# CNF Best Practice Proposal (CBPP)

A  CNF Best Practice Proposal (CBPP) is a way to propose, communicate and coordinate on new best practices for the CNF WG. You can read the full details of the project in [CBPP-1](0001-cnf-best-practice-proposal-process.md)

This process is still in an alpha state and feedback is welcome.

## Quick start for the CBPP process

Socialize an idea with the CNF WG. You can send your idea to the mailing list, or add it to the agenda for one of the upcoming meetings. Make sure that others think the work is worth taking up and will help review the CBPP and any code changes required.

Follow the process outlined in the [CBPP process document](0001-cnf-best-practice-proposal-process.md) and use the [CBPP template](NNNN-cbpp-template.md) to create a new proposal. Submit a pull request to add the proposal to the repository.

## CNF Use Cases

CBPP shall always refer to at least one of the CNF WG use cases. Those use cases serve as the practical and concrete basis for deriving, discussing and evaluating the best practices for CNFs. Their value is in providing context and a reality check for CBPPs. With help of use cases we make sure that CBPPs are addressing a specific problem or need from the real world. Please use the [Use Case Template](../use-case/NNNN-UC-template.md) to contribute a use case.
