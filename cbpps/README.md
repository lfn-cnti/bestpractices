# CNF Best Practice Proposal (CBPP)

A  CNF Best Practice Proposal (CBPP) is a way to propose, communicate and coordinate on new best practices for the CNF WG. You can read the full details of the project in [CBPP-1](0001-cnf-best-practice-proposal-process.md)

This process is still in an alpha state and feedback is welcome.

## Quick start for the CBPP process

Follow the process outlined in the [CBPP process document](cnf_best_practice_process.md).

## CNF Use Cases

CBPP shall always refer to at least one of the CNF WG use cases. Those use cases serve as the practical and concrete basis for deriving, discussing and evaluating the best practices for CNFs. Their value is in providing context and a reality check for CBPPs. With help of use cases we make sure that CBPPs are addressing a specific problem or need from the real world. Please use the [Use Case Template](../use-case/NNNN-UC-template.md) to contribute a use case.
