# Networking Use Cases

It's clearer that a best practice is a good course of action when it satisfies the needs of a Kubernetes use case related to one or more actors.

This folder contains different use cases, their description, references, and other context.  The best practices, recorded elsewhere, refer back to these use cases for their justification.

Goal:

- Relating to real world use cases.
- Discussion of core features and functionality from use cases and their NFs.
- Examination of existing use cases to discussion of kubenative implementations which provide the core features and functionality.

## How to add a new use case

If you just have a partially-formed idea for a use case feel free to add to the discussion topic [listing networking uses cases](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/discussions/39).  This is the best place to go if you aren't sure how to write up the use case.  We can help you expand that into a full description.

Once you have a new use case you would like to discuss in more depth, create a new [GitHub discussion topic](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/discussions) with the details you have including attachments and/or links to any external content (eg. Google docs, hackmd, diagrams).

If you have enough content to writeup a full use case then feel free to create a pull request in this [use case folder](./) with either a

- single Markdown file with all content included (including in-line diagrams) for the use case
- new use case folder with all content with a README.md as the starting point describing the use case.

If you're going to do this via a pull request you must have a complete description of the use case.   You should have gathered any information you need and included it by this point.  We will then discuss the merits of the use case during review of the pull request, but this is not the time to be writing large sections of it.
