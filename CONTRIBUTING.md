## How to Contribute

### [Come to Meetings](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg#meetings)

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an
invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don’t have
anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings [here](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg#meetings). You don’t have to turn on
your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough.
Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving
feedback on others’ ideas. Simply sharing your own ideas, and experiences can help in ways you might not initially realize.

### Join a GitHub Discussion

- Go to the [GitHub Discussion board](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/discussions)
- Participate in existing discussions
  - eg. [Defining actors and audiences](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/discussions/30)
- Add new discussion topics
- Reference Issues, PRs, and existing content from the [CNF WG repo](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg)

### Find an Issue

Review, contribute to, create new [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/issues).

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [good first issue](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/labels/good%20first%20issue) has extra information to
help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/labels/help%20wanted) are issues
suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after
your first pull request.

Sometimes there won’t be any issues with these labels. That’s ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don’t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out to one of the [co-chairs](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg#current-co-chairs).  

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.
