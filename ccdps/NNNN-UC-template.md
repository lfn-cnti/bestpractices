## Involved parties
*TIP: In this section you can list main parties who are involved in the use case. For example:<br>
Business customer of CSP<br>
Operations Team of CSP<br>
Service team of CNF Vendor<br>
Etc.*

## Involved system entities
*TIP: In this section you can list system entities that are involved in the use case. For example:<br>
Data Center Network<br>
Wide Area Network<br>
Cloud Native Platform<br>
CNF X<br>

Etc.*

## Situation
*TIP: Please describe situation related to this use case. Indicate what are intents and expectations of different parties as well as the roles and requirements of different system components. Describe how everything is related. Drawings, flow and system diagrams are beneficial here. This part, as the subject says, shall give the reader clear overview of the situation as the starting point for evaluation of the use case. It should not contain the detailed technical descriptions and analysis.*

## Expected behaviour
*TIP: Here you can provide detailed technical descriptions and depict expected behaviour of system entities and components regardless of cloud nativeness. Please highlight what are different entities expected to provide. Depending on the use case you can look at it from different angles e.g. CNF angle, Cloud Native Platform angle, Network angle etc. This section should give the reader clear understanding of expected behaviour.

## Challenges and limitations with Kube-native approach
*TIP: This section will give us main inputs for discussion and evaluation of best practices. You should describe which challenges and limitations kube-native approach presents for this use case. You can give technical details about what is not possible with kube-native approach and elaborate why is that relevant. You can again look from multiple angles. If there are some established practices that are used to work around these limitations please describe those in the chapter below*

### Established practices to overcome challenges and limitations
*TIP: If such practices exist please elaborate them here in sufficient technical details. Please provide refences. Please give your opinion weather or not these practices can be considered as candidates for CNF best practices in line with [CCDP description](0001-cnf-conformance-definition-proposal.md).*

### What needs to be done differently in order to overcome challenges and limitations 
*TIP: If there are no established practices and you have ideas or if you believe things related to this use case should be done differently please indicate it shortly here. The purpose of this is to earmark some potential inputs for CCDP process. It is not expected to elaborate CCDPs here.
