# Cloud Native Network Function Working Group (CNF-WG)

The Cloud Native Network Function WG (CNF WG) operates under the aegis of CNCF. The focus of the CNF WG is to define the process around evaluating the cloud nativeness of networking applications, aka CNFs. We collaborate with the [CNF Test Suite project](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite#cnf-conformance-test-suite) who work on the mechanics of the conformance tests.

The primary goal for this group is to provide a set of cloud native + Kubenative best practices for network applications.

The [CNF WG Charter](charter.md) further outlines the scope of our group activities as well as intended deliverables.

The [CNF Test Suite](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite) will support testing a set of these best practices to allow developers and network operators to evaluate how well a network application follows cloud native principles and best practices. Proposals which have been adopted by the CNF WG are listed in the [CNF Best Practice Proposal](cbpps/) folder.
