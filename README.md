# Cloud Native Telecom Initiative (CNTi) Best Practices

The CNTi Best Practices focus area operates under the aegis of LFN. The scope of this focus area is to define cloud native networking best practices. We collaborate with the CNTi [Test Catalog](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/x/HgAxBw) and CNTi [Certification](https://github.com/lfn-cnti/certification) focus areas who work on the implementation and mechanics of the test catalog and the definition of cloud native certifications. 

The [CNTi Test Catalog](https://github.com/cnti-testcatalog/testsuite) will support testing a set of these best practices to allow developers and network operators to evaluate how well a network application follows cloud native principles and best practices. Proposals which have been adopted by the CNTi Best Practices focus area are listed in the [Best Practice Proposal](doc/cbpps/) folder.

- Key areas of focus
  - Works with community members, projects, infra providers, CNF vendors, and end users to identify pressing cloud-native networking challenges.
  - Develops vendor-neutral [Best Practices for CNF Developers](doc/best_cnf_dev.md) for cloud-native workloads and other networking-related applications that want to leverage cloud-native principles.
  - Proactively engages with LF Networking projects to identify challenges or pain points where best practices (community-agreed approaches) will add value.
  - Publishes community-agreed best practices.


- Not in scope for this focus area
  - Identifying or implementing tests for the testing catalog.
  - Identifying or defining cloud-native certifications.
