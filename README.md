# Cloud Native Telecom Initiative (CNTI) Best Practices

The CNTI Best Practices focus area operates under the aegis of LFN. The scope of this focus area is to define cloud native networking best practices. We collaborate with the [Test Catalog](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/x/HgAxBw) and [Certification](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/display/LN/3+-+Certification) focus areas who work on the implementation and mechanics of the test catalog and the definition of cloud native certifications. 

- Key areas of focus
  - Works with community members, projects, infra providers, CNF vendors, and end users to identify pressing cloud-native networking challenges.
  - Develops vendor-neutral best practices for cloud-native infra, workloads, and other networking-related applications that want to leverage cloud-native principles.
  - Proactively engages with LF Networking projects to identify challenges or pain points where best practices (community-agreed approaches) will add value.
  - Publishes community-agreed best practices.


- Not in scope for this focus area

  - Identifying or implementing tests for the testing catalog.
  - Identifying or defining cloud-native certifications.

* [Best Practices for CNF Developers](doc/best_cnf_dev.md)

The [CNF WG Charter](charter.md) further outlines the scope of our group activities as well as intended deliverables.

The [CNF Test Suite](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite) will support testing a set of these best practices to allow developers and network operators to evaluate how well a network application follows cloud native principles and best practices. Proposals which have been adopted by the CNF WG are listed in the [CNF Best Practice Proposal](doc/cbpps/) folder.
